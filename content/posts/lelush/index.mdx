# Merch Design

Le Lush is a modern CBD and wellness brand. I worked on some apparel design for their Fall 2019 collection.
The theme for the collection was entitled "Study Abroad." I took that and put together a few pieces that were
inspired by souvenir graphics.

## Elbow Grease

I actually spent a Saturday doing a very subtle marble Tie Dye on some of the shirts for them.
