# Branding for an Agency/Consultancy

Frenetic Labs is the Creation of Ryan Metzler. I met Ryan while working at Polar Notion. He runs a maker's space
in Atlanta and helps companies and agencies with all sorts of needs ranging from hardware to software.

## The Business Card

Ryan had been working with an old pen plotter for art projects so we wanted to figure out a way for him to utilize that for 
business cards. The idea here was to have the plotter draw all the black strokes and stamp his logo on them in red. This 
would perfectly sum up Ryan's unique approach to technology and his maker's spirit.

## Supporting Elements

<p className="mb-24">We wanted some supporting elements for the brand so we put together a collection of bitmapped gradients and shapes. 
These are reminiscent of the technology of yesteryear.</p>

<h2 className="mt-24">The Logo</h2>

The logo takes cues from a minimal and retro technology company. The goal was to come up with a brand mark 
that simplifies and abstracts the idea of hardware and software. The square representing the screens that we 
have such intimate relationships with through software. The circle representing the button. The most basic form of user input
in hardware.
