# Event Graphics and  Landing Page

Portrait is a coffee roaster and coffee shop in the West End of Atlanta. I worked with them on creating
some event graphics.

## Kickstarter Landing Page

When they were still working on raising funding through Kickstarter I took their bag design and
created a simple landing page for them with Gatsby.js and Netlify.
