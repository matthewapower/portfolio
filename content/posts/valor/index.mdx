# Merch, Brand, and Packaging Design

Valor is a coffee shop in Alpharetta, GA. The heart of the their cafe is hospitality and you feel that as soon as you 
walk in the door. I worked on some concepts for a hat for them to sell. They ended up liking one concept for the hat and 
taking another one (the smile logo) to put a fun spin on their brand in a few different areas

## Valor Promotional Packaging

I also did a design for a pack of instant coffee. They passed these out to promote the opening of their cafe.
